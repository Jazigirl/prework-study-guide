#   Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This application was created to be an aid for Coding Bootcamp students in the different tools needed to create a functional webpage. Wanting to help lay out a functional direct website that is easy to use was important to me for the fact of knowing what it is like to want extra guides and useful information when learning something new. This study guide limits the amount of having to look in different places for knowledge and puts most of it onto one webpage. I learned alot about creating files and different elements that go into creating a webpage that is appealing yet useful to use.

The console on Devtools is also able to be accessed and there it is seen that JavaScript is running. The Devtools consoles allows user to see and lists the topics that was learned from the prework and chooses one topic for us to study first.
